# provider-template

`provider-template` is a minimal [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider
that is meant to be used as a template for implementing new Providers. It comes
with the following features that are meant to be refactored:

- A `ProviderConfig` type that only points to a credentials `Secret`.
- A `MyType` resource type that serves as an example managed resource.
- A managed resource controller that reconciles `MyType` objects and simply
  prints their configuration in its `Observe` method.
